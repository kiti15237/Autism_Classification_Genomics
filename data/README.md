# Data

This directory contains the data used to run all of the code in this repository.

# Contents

The files in this directory are as follows:

- lof matrix files (*.af0.50.txt) binary CGT matrix files defining genotypes of individuals at likely lof variants for cases (asd) and controls (typical) in the Simons Simplex Collection (ssc) or AGRE (v34) datasets
- ped files (*.ped) describing family relationships of AGRE (v34) and SSC (ssc) individuals 
- label file (all_samples_filtered*)describes asd diagnosis and other important phenotypic features for an overlapping set of individuals to AGRE and SSC

# Wall lab file origins

Each of these files was copied from another Wall lab folder.  The last known working directories of these files are listed below, in case reference files need to be found by a Wall lab member.

- lof matrix files are found in /scratch/PI/dpwall/DATA/iHART/kpaskov/CGT/data/
- label file is in /scratch/PI/dpwall/DATA/iHART/kpaskov/PhenotypeGLRM/data/all_samples_filtered_labels.csv
